# birthdayEmailer
Python script that has eliminated my dependency on Facebook for birthday notifications by emailing me daily which of my friends have birthdays. 

Chrome has an extension called "Birthday Calendar Extractor for Facebook" that will import your friends' birthdays from Facebook into an ICS or CSV format.

Use your CSV as the input for this script. Enjoy all your free time away from checking for birthdays on Facebook!
